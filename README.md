# Data-Cleaning-on-GoogleSheet-Excel
This dirty data was obtained from Kaggle. It contains sales record of different confectionaries, their cost, date of purchase, purchase ID, among other necessary details. This data is beginner-friendly and useful in practising your data analysis skills after a long time.
## Project Overview
In the analysis of this data, insights are provided to the store owner into the purchasing power, sales and best business days and months through the revenue generated and the number of items sold. While working on this data, I ensured that the purpose of the analysis was fully observed and executed.

### Data Source
The data was readily available on Kaggle by Ahmed Mohamed with the title: Cafe Sales - Dirty Data for Cleaning Training <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training>

### Tools
- Excel & Google Sheet for data cleaning and visualisation

### Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I downloaded the dataset on Kaggle, then proceeded to upload it to Microsoft Excel, where I sorted for missing values and outliers. I first selected the entire sheet (ctrl+A), then proceeded to filter.
The filter button made it easy to find UKNOWN, ERRORS and BLANKS.

After each row is cleaned, missing values properly filled, I copied the downloaded data from Excel and uploaded it to a Google sheet, which I find to be more user-friendly, and then, I split the date into day of week, month and year. Then I created pivot table(s) to derive insights into the data. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis involves asking questions about the data that meet specific conditions, such as:
- The total amount spent on specific confectionery (the most sold confectionery)
- Total quantity sold
- Month with the highest quantity sold.
